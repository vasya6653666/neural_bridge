## Customize this Power for your team

This Power ships as a template. The defaults work out of the box, but feature management conventions vary widely across teams and industries. Edit the following before rolling it out broadly:

- **High-risk domains** in `steering/high-risk-domains.md` — replace the payments example with your own domains (auth, billing, data migrations, public API, etc.).
- **Naming convention** in `steering/feature-flag-conventions.md` — the default is `{domain}-{feature}-{variant}`; swap for whatever pattern your team uses.
- **Rollout milestones** in `steering/rollout-guidance.md` — default is 10% → 50% → 100% with 24-hour holds; adjust for your release cadence.
- **Cleanup cadence** in `steering/cleanup-cadence.md` — default flags-this-stale threshold is 14 days at 100%; adjust for your tolerance.
- **Hook file patterns** in `hooks/*.neuralbridge.hook` — defaults target `src/payments/**/*.ts`; change to match your highest-risk directories.

Every customizable spot in the steering files is marked with an HTML comment: `<!-- CUSTOMIZE: ... -->`. Search for `CUSTOMIZE` to find them all.

# Onboarding

Run these steps in order the first time this Power activates. If the user has completed a step already, skip it.

## Step 0: Choose your transport

The Unleash MCP server is available in two modes. Ask the user which one they want, then continue with the matching path:

| Mode | When to use | Setup cost |
|---|---|---|
| **Local stdio** (default) | Individual developer with Node.js 18+ and permission to run `npx`. Works against any Unleash instance. | Set 3 env vars, no admin action needed. |
| **Remote HTTP** | Org disallows local MCP processes, or you prefer Unleash-hosted. Requires admin to enable remote MCP on the instance and the org to permit OAuth 2.0 DCR. | One env var, but admin must toggle "Remote MCP server" in Admin settings first. |

If the user picks **remote**, copy the contents of `examples/mcp.remote.json` over `mcp.json` and replace `https://your-instance.getunleash.io` with their instance URL. Verify reachability with `curl -I https://<instance>/api/admin/mcp` — a `401 Unauthorized` is expected (proves the endpoint exists; auth happens in the next step).

If the user picks **local** (default), keep `mcp.json` as-is and verify Node with `node --version` (needs 18+).

## Step 1: Verify prerequisites

| Requirement | Mode | Verify with |
|---|---|---|
| Unleash instance (Cloud or self-hosted) | both | `curl -I ${UNLEASH_BASE_URL}` returns 200 or 401 |
| Personal Access Token with flag-management permissions | both | Manage in Unleash Admin → API access → Personal access tokens |
| Node.js 18+ | local only | `node --version` |
| Remote MCP enabled on the Unleash instance | remote only | Unleash Admin → Admin settings → Remote MCP server is **Enabled** |
| OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration allowed | remote only | Confirm with your org's identity provider |

## Step 2: Set environment variables

Both modes use `${VAR}` expansion. Create a credentials file and source it from the shell that launches NeuralBridge:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.unleash
cat > ~/.unleash/mcp.env << 'EOF'
UNLEASH_BASE_URL=https://your-instance.getunleash.io/api
UNLEASH_PAT=your-personal-access-token
UNLEASH_DEFAULT_PROJECT=default
EOF
chmod 600 ~/.unleash/mcp.env
```

Add to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
if [ -f ~/.unleash/mcp.env ]; then
  source ~/.unleash/mcp.env
  export UNLEASH_BASE_URL UNLEASH_PAT UNLEASH_DEFAULT_PROJECT
fi
```

Restart the shell, then restart NeuralBridge. When NeuralBridge shows the "unapproved environment variables" popup, click **Allow** for `UNLEASH_BASE_URL`, `UNLEASH_PAT`, and `UNLEASH_DEFAULT_PROJECT`. NeuralBridge only expands variables that have been explicitly approved.

**Remote mode only needs `UNLEASH_PAT`** (the URL is in `mcp.json` directly), but setting all three is harmless and lets the user switch transports later without re-doing the env work.

## Step 3: Install hook templates (optional)

This Power ships two hook templates in `hooks/`. They are **not installed automatically** — hooks fire on real IDE events and consume NeuralBridge credits, so they should be opt-in and customized to the user's project.

Ask the user: *"Want me to install the file-save and flag-audit hook templates into `.neuralbridge/hooks/`? You should edit the file pattern in the file-save hook before enabling it."*

If yes, copy both files into `.neuralbridge/hooks/`:

```bash
mkdir -p .neuralbridge/hooks
cp hooks/evaluate-high-risk-save.neuralbridge.hook .neuralbridge/hooks/
cp hooks/flag-audit.neuralbridge.hook .neuralbridge/hooks/
```

Then open `hooks/README.md` for guidance on which fields to customize before enabling.

# When to load steering files

NeuralBridge should load steering files contextually based on the task at hand. Map workflows to files:

| User intent | Load |
|---|---|
| Setting up feature flags, deciding when to flag a change, naming a new flag | `steering/feature-flag-conventions.md` |
| Working in a high-risk directory (payments, auth, data migrations, external integrations) | `steering/high-risk-domains.md` |
| Planning a gradual rollout, configuring percentages, setting halt conditions | `steering/rollout-guidance.md` |
| Removing a feature flag, cleaning up after a successful rollout, auditing stale flags | `steering/cleanup-cadence.md` |

For tasks that span multiple workflows (e.g., "create a flag and plan the rollout"), load both relevant files.

# Tool reference

The Unleash MCP server exposes the following tools.

| Tool | Description | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `evaluate_change` | Analyzes a code change and determines whether it should be behind a feature flag. | Before implementing risky changes |
| `detect_flag` | Searches for existing flags that match a description to prevent duplicates. | Before creating new flags |
| `create_flag` | Creates a new feature flag with proper naming, typing, and metadata. | When no suitable flag exists |
| `wrap_change` | Generates framework-specific code to guard a feature behind a flag. | After creating a flag |
| `list_projects` | Lists Unleash projects available to the configured token, with optional pagination. | Discovering available projects |
| `list_flags` | Lists feature flags in a project (active by default; set archived=true for archived flags). | Auditing flag inventory; discovering existing flags before creating new ones |
| `get_flag_state` | Returns the current state, strategies, and metadata for a flag. | Debugging, status checks |
| `set_flag_rollout` | Configures rollout percentages and activation strategies. | Gradual releases |
| `toggle_flag_environment` | Enables or disables a flag in a specific environment. | Testing, staged rollouts |
| `remove_flag_strategy` | Deletes a rollout strategy from a flag. | Simplifying flag configuration |
| `cleanup_flag` | Returns file locations and instructions for removing a flag after rollout. | After full rollout |

The read-only tools — `get_flag_state`, `detect_flag`, `evaluate_change`, `list_projects`, and `list_flags` — are pre-approved (`autoApprove`) in `mcp.json` so the agent can use them without prompting. Write operations like `create_flag`, `set_flag_rollout`, and `cleanup_flag` always require explicit user approval — keep it that way unless the user has a specific reason to lower the bar.
